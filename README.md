#  Voice-Controlled Tic Tac Toe

Hey there, Zaid here and 
This is a Python-based Tic Tac Toe game that you can play completely hands-free using **voice commands**.  
It integrates **speech-to-text** for move inputs and **text-to-speech** for prompts, making the experience interactive and engaging for two players.

##  How It Works
1. **Game Setup**
   - The board is displayed as a 3x3 matrix with positions from `(0,0)` to `(2,2)`.  
   - Players enter their names and choose their sign: **X** or **O**.  

2. **Gameplay**  
   - Players speak their moves in the format `x.y` (e.g., `1.2` for row 1, column 2).  
   - The game listens via microphone (`SpeechRecognition`) and converts speech to text.  
   - Valid moves are placed on the board using `numpy` for matrix handling.  

3. **Interaction**  
   - The game uses `pyttsx3` to announce prompts like asking for a move or declaring a winner.  
   - Invalid inputs or occupied positions prompt the player to try again.  

4. **Win Checking**  
   - After every move, the game checks all rows, columns, and diagonals for a winning combination.  
   - If a player wins, their name is announced and the game ends.  
   - If the board is full without a winner, it declares a draw.
